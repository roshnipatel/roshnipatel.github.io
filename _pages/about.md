We primarily work on understanding the genetic architecture and evolutionary history of complex traits. Bridging statistical genetics and population genetics, we are especially interested in understanding how the variation underlying complex traits is distributed across populations, and how combining information across populations enables us to better understand trait architecture. Other interests include gene expression and regulation; genetic interactions (i.e. GxG and GxE); admixture; and polygenic score portability. 

We are first and foremost motivated by understanding biology, but we also seek out opportunities to develop bespoke statistical or computational solutions to the problems we work on. Our work generally combines theory and modeling with methods development and data analysis.

Given the ethical considerations that arise when working with human genetic data — and especially data from groups that have been historically excluded from or exploited in biomedical research — we are committed to conducting our research in a manner that is explicit about equity. This includes both engaging with the history of our field and critically evaluating our own work in order to anticipate potential harms.

We also work on questions that fall under the scope of science and society, metascience, and ELSI (ethical, legal, and social implications of human genetics). We are interested in understanding the rationale behind and impact of scientific practices in statistical and population genetics, especially relating to the use of race, ancestry, and other population descriptors. Our ultimate goal is to develop resources and strategies for enabling more socially responsible science.
