	abstract = {Despite the growing number of genome-wide association studies (GWASs), it remains unclear to what extent gene-by-gene and gene-by-environment interactions influence complex traits in humans. The magnitude of genetic interactions in complex traits has been difficult to quantify because GWASs are generally underpowered to detect individual interactions of small effect. Here, we develop a method to test for genetic interactions that aggregates information across all trait-associated loci. Specifically, we test whether SNPs in regions of European ancestry shared between European American and admixed African American individuals have the same causal effect sizes. We hypothesize that in African Americans, the presence of genetic interactions will drive the causal effect sizes of SNPs in regions of European ancestry to be more similar to those of SNPs in regions of African ancestry. We apply our method to two traits: gene expression in 296 African Americans and 482 European Americans in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in 74K African Americans and 296K European Americans in the Million Veteran Program (MVP). We find significant evidence for genetic interactions in our analysis of gene expression; for LDL-C, we observe a similar point estimate, although this is not significant, most likely due to lower statistical power. These results suggest that gene-by-gene or gene-by-environment interactions modify the effect sizes of causal variants in human complex traits.},

	abstract = {Natural selection on complex traits is difficult to study in part due to the ascertainment inherent to genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The power to detect a trait-associated variant in GWAS is a function of its frequency and effect size – but for traits under selection, the effect size of a variant determines the strength of selection against it, constraining its frequency. Recognizing the biases inherent to GWAS ascertainment, we propose studying the joint distribution of allele frequencies across populations, conditional on the frequencies in the GWAS cohort. Before considering these conditional frequency spectra, we first characterized the impact of selection and non-equilibrium demography on allele frequency dynamics forwards and backwards in time. We then used these results to understand conditional frequency spectra under realistic human demography. Finally, we investigated empirical conditional frequency spectra for GWAS variants associated with 106 complex traits, finding compelling evidence for either stabilizing or purifying selection. Our results provide insights into polygenic score portability and other properties of variants ascertained with GWAS, highlighting the utility of conditional frequency spectra.},

	abstract = {Regulatory proteins have evolved diverse repressor domains (RDs) to enable precise context-specific repression of transcription. However, our understanding of how sequence variation impacts the functional activity of RDs is limited. To address this gap, we generated a high-throughput mutational scanning dataset measuring the repressor activity of 115,000 variant sequences spanning more than 50 RDs in human cells. We identified thousands of clinical variants with loss or gain of repressor function, including TWIST1 HLH variants associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome and MECP2 domain variants associated with Rett syndrome. We also leveraged these data to annotate short linear interacting motifs (SLiMs) that are critical for repression in disordered RDs. Then, we designed a deep learning model called TENet (Transcriptional Effector Network) that integrates sequence, structure and biochemical representations of sequence variants to accurately predict repressor activity. We systematically tested generalization within and across domains with varying homology using the mutational scanning dataset. Finally, we employed TENet within a directed evolution sequence editing framework to tune the activity of both structured and disordered RDs and experimentally test thousands of designs. Our work highlights critical considerations for future dataset design and model training strategies to improve functional variant prioritization and precision design of synthetic regulatory proteins.},
